                  <p>On oddsportal.com, an odds comparison service, I've randomly selected an event and we're
                    looking at the
                    odds offered by Pinnacle, SBOBET and a few other bookmakers.
                    There are two possible outcomes: (1) and (2).
                    Let's say I'm a big believer in (1) and I'll be placing my bet at Pinnacle.
                    The odds are 1.9 and I'll write them in the first text box from above.
                    Since they offer 2.02 for the opposite outcome, I'll write "2.02" in the second text box.
                    We're done with Step 1! This one was the easiest.

                  Is your bookmaker or exchange applying a commission to deposit or withdraw? Check right now! If it
                  does, man up:
                  do not bet, withdraw immediately and never look back. Hidden costs are the mark of scummy businesses.
                  When you buy something from a supermarket, you don't pay an extra charge for every dollar spent.
                  You also don't pay a commission if you still got some money in your wallet at the exit.
                  This behaviour is never acceptable. It also makes calculating the real odds impossible.

                  <p>If there is enough interest for the app, a forth column will be added: FLB-adjusted Probability.
                    FLB means "favorite-longshot bias" but I'm also considering the reverse favorite-longshot bias.
                    In order for it to work, it will ask if the pick is at moneyline or what is the handicap, and what is the sport.</p>

                  <p>After that it will use these studies in order to give an idea of an even truthier probability
                    (note that these anomalies in market efficiency usually happen either with heavy favorites or with heavy underdogs):</p>

                  <strong>Money Line</strong>
                  <p>The favorite-longshot bias has been documented in sports where heavy favorites often exist:</p>

                    <li>baseball (Woodland and Woodland, 1994)</li>
